This is a impossible mission, I think.

I want to do this project by only myself.

It's a:

1. Customized linux OS.
2. Using for server purpose.
3. Storage manager/virtualizer.
4. Hypervistor include Virtual-Machine runability.
5. Cluster node support more then two nodes clustering mode.
6. Replicator support synchronized or asynchronized data replication between nodes.
7. Data receiver that support data replication from unix/linux/windows/macos.
8. DR manager who manage data replicating process by operating the agents running on guest OS.
9. Data deduplicator.
10. Modulerized system, you can choose different functions to be involved.

And finally, It's a web managed system.
